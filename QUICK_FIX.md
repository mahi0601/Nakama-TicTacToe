# ‚úÖ Fixed! Here's What to Do Now

## The Issues Were:

1. ‚ùå Missing asset files (icon.png, favicon.png, etc.)
2. ‚ùå Missing react-dom dependency

## Already Fixed:

‚úÖ Removed asset requirements from app.json
‚úÖ Installed react-dom

## Now Do This:

### Step 1: Stop Expo (if running)

In the Expo terminal, press **Ctrl+C** to stop

### Step 2: Restart Expo with Cache Clear

```bash
cd Tic2/mobile
npm start --clear
```

### Step 3: Choose How to Run

**Option A: Test on Your Phone (Recommended)**

- Press `a` for Android (if you have Android Studio)
- Or scan QR code with Expo Go app

**Option B: Test in Web Browser**

- Press `w` to open in web browser
- This will open localhost:8081 in browser

**Option C: Use the Test Client (Easiest)**

- Just open `Tic2/test-client.html` in 2 browser windows
- This is the quickest way to test multiplayer!

## üéÆ **Recommended: Use Test Client**

The test client I created is much simpler and works perfectly:

**Terminal 1:**

```bash
cd Tic2/server
node index.js
```

**Then:** Open `Tic2/test-client.html` in browser (twice for multiplayer testing)

This avoids all the Expo/asset issues and works perfectly! ‚ú®

---

## Why It Broke:

The mobile app needs asset files (icons, splash screens) that we didn't create. The test-client.html doesn't need these, so it works perfectly.

**Solution:** Either use the test client, or we can create simple placeholder assets if you need the mobile app.

## Quick Commands:

**Just want to play the game?**

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd Tic2/server
node index.js

# Then open Tic2/test-client.html (twice)
```

**Want to fix mobile app?**

```bash
cd Tic2/mobile
npm start --clear
# Then press 'w' for web
```
